=================================

This will spawn in all objects and the arena on Altis at the coordinates 27875.4, 21662.8, 0. It's a completely containerized solo arena where waves of AI will need to be fought by one player. The player enters the arena, utlizes the trigger I've placed on the switch object in front of them which will lock them in to fight waves of AI. There is additionally a commmented out section in the GKATSOLOArenaObjectCreate.sqf labeled //Surface to Air Missile// that you can uncomment. This will create an invincible SAM system to keep players flying around it away that could help cheat the system by spotting enemies from a distance.
